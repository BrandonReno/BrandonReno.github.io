                As a child I was told that the best people in life shared the same three attributes. They were loving, caring, and responsible. I always took this and tried my best to align myself with these 
                traits. I foud it relatively easy to love and care for others because of the great relationship my parents demonstrated to me when I was young. I remember always seeing them so happy and thinking how badly I wanted to make someone
                that happy some day. My father taught me to be responsible and to follow the rules to a certain degree. Since he was a cop my entire younger life I felt that it was very easy to follow the rules and not 
                get into things that I know I shouldnt. My younger life was filled with family activities and rarely hanging out with many friends. I was very introverted at a young age. I had one or two friends but I always 
                felt like the thrid wheel in groups of three. I felt most comofrtable around my family who seemed to accept me as who ever I was. For this reason I always stayed close with my family, even today at 23 years old not a week goes by where I have not communciated with my mom or dad.
                At the end of the day they brought me up and raised me in an enviornment that I was blessed to be raised in and I am blessed to have two parents who
                truly care more about me than anything in the world.

            <p>
                In 2016 I made one of the hardest yet rewarding decisions of my life. I committed to swinm for University of The Pacific in Stockton California. Little did I know when making this 
                decision how much this university would change me and shape me into the person I am today. I chose University of The Pacific because of the small class sizes, being an introvert out of highschool I felt
                that the smaller the class the better the chance I could form a connection with the professors. Pacific also had a great swim team that had score very well in their past conference championship. They had dreams of 
                winning their conference and that excited me. While at Pacific I was able to grow as an athlete, student, and person. I decided to study in a program called Media X. This program focuses on technology and art and how the two 
                intersect. For my case, I concentrated on Computer Science and Technical Animation. Through these courses I learned the ins and outs of both software engineering and development as well as learning how these practices can be 
                beneficial and used in animation software such as Maya. I found myself really interested in animation and the pipeline process but more so interested in software and artificial intelligence by my senior year. With this interest
                I applied to get my masters in engineering sciences focused in computer science to build my skills as an engineer. At this point I have completed one semester of my program and have one to go.

            <h1>Swimming</h1>
            <p>
                When I was seven years old I went with my friend to his recreational swim team practice. I walked in and saw the team cheering and throwing a giant plush spongebob squarepants into the air off a tent. It was magical to see as a little guy
                and I went home that day and told my parents all about it. As a kid I loved swimming because it introduced me to friends and was a great way to spend afternoons in the summer. Loving the sport I began swimming competitively for Wolverine Aquatics when I turned 12.
                Competitive swimming was much more difficult than rec and this is when I really began to fall in love with the grind of the sport. The early mornings spent practicing and late nights spent working out all for the hopes of dropping even just a second off of your best time.
                I swam with Wolverines even throughout my college years during the summers. In March of 2020 I achieved my life long dream of qualifying for the Olympic Trials. I was sad when the meet was postponed a year due to Covid, but was hopeful for what I could do after another season of training.
                What I learned most from swimming is not how to go fast, or how to wake up early. I learned how to be a leader, and I was rewarded with the honor of leading my college team as a team captain for both my junior and senior years. Swimming taught me friendship, hardwork, and communication will always outperform
                pure talent. I learned just how hard you have to work to achieve goals and I learned how to focus immensely on what I want and to do anything in my power to make it happen. As a team captain I learned how to communicate with people of varying skill levels as well as discuss difficult topics with high up faculty members
                and coaches. My time swimming is coming to an end as I have just over 5 months left until the Olympic Trials, but I will always remember the dedication and love this sport brought me and just how much it shaped me into who I am today.

            <h1>Why Give Me a Next Step?</h1>
            <p>What makes a person a great employee? If you asked me this question when I was young the answer would be easy. I would say a great employee
                is someone who is super smart and got the absolute highest degree in school. Yup, little Brandon Reno did not know much about the world until highschool. In highschool
                I had a ceramics teacher, a teacher that to this day I have not forgotten. This teacher always did his best to inspire his students and one day we were talking about 
                our upcoming project when he said this.
            </p>
            <h1>"In all Things in Life Always Remember to Master Your Craft"</h1>
            <p>
                This quote has stuck with me since the day my teacher said it. Master my craft, I took that to heart and with everything I did and do now from that day forward I always 
                strive for mastery and excellence. My teacher inspired me that day, and since then I have wanted to inspire others in a similar way.
