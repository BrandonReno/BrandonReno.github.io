            Using Python and Tensorflow I developed a system that can classify film revenue 58.70% of the time. This was a large scale project that required lots of research into previous revenue classification models to see how I could improve
            off of previous research. The first phase of this project was spent conducting research on neural network models that predicted revenue to get a good baseline percentage of what a model can achieve given the right data. I found quickly
            that many all models included traditional data but none seemed to include data from film awards. I thought this was interesting and decided to develop my model using both Oscar and film data to illustrate if the addition of award data could help achieve a higher
            classification accuracy. With the development of my model I found that my accuracy of 58.70% was much higher performing than other developed models which on average scored anywhere between 36-48%. I was then able to conclude that Oscar data did help improve
            the classification accuracy of neural networks.
