        <h1>Welcome to my Website</h>
        <p>
            <span class="tab"></span> Hi! My name is Brandon Reno and I am currently a Computer Science graduate student at University of The Pacific. When applying for
            jobs I often find it hard to express who I am as a person through just my resume or cover letter. There is so much more to
            the best employees than just their qualifications for a position. To illustrate who I am as a person beyond my resume I created this site. <br>
            <span class="tab"></span>Content on this site will focus on who I am as a person in hopes of introducing
            myself in a personal light. My site is split up into three pages, About Me, Projects, and Resume. 
            As could be assume the resume section is just a copy of my most current resume. This was included to re iterate myself
            as a candidate to whoever is viewing this site. About me will give my story from a yung age up until the present.
            This page will share traits that I feel define me, when they started shining and how they can transfer to the workforce.
            Finally my project page will give an organized view on projects that I have created throughout my undergraduate and graduate years in university.
            The purpose of this is to showcase projects that I am proud of in a deeper light. If you would like to contact me further please feel free
            to reach out to my email written in the top right of the navigation bar.<br><br> <span class="tab"></span>With that being said I hope you enjoy learning more about myself outside of a resume view.
            Also, feel free to connect with me on Linked In!
